# Unit Testing

## Example Implementations
* Mocha
  * Completely Open Source
  * Very mature
  * Configuration heavy
  * Does not include assertion syntax by default, but compatible with a variety of libraries
    * `should.js`, `chai`, `expect.js`
  * Tests are invoked with mocha `this` context, so arrow functions are discouraged

* Jest
  * Created by Facebook
  * Open Source
  * Easy testing of React
  * Configuration light
